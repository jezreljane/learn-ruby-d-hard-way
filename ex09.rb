# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# Display days all in a single line..
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# Display month one after another line..
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

puts "Here are the days: ", days
puts "Here are the months: ", months

# Don't forget that <<PARAGRAPH has no space in between..
puts <<PARAGRAPH
There's something going on here.
With the PARAGRAPH thing
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
PARAGRAPH
